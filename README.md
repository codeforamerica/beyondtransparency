## About this Book


This book is a resource for (and by) practitioners inside and outside government—from the municipal chief information officer to the community organizer to the civic-minded entrepreneur. Beyond Transparency is intended to capture and distill the community's learnings around open data for the past four years. And we know that the community is going to continue learning. That's why, in addition to the print version of the book which you can order on Amazon, we've also published the digital version of this book on this site under a Creative Commons license. The full text of this site is on GitHub — which means that anyone can submit a pull request with a suggested edit. Help us improve this resource for the community and write the next edition of Beyond Transparency by submitting your pull requests.

Code for America is a national nonprofit committed to building a government for the people, by the people, that works in the 21st century.
